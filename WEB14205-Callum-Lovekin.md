### Introduction

This project was about how to create a physical and digital game to help educate kids or businesses. I and my teammate worked on creating a board game that is both fun and educational. This project was a fun project to work on as it made me learn new skills I wouldn't of learned otherwise.

![Idea](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CallumLovekin28/TM-Summative/master/Images/Concept.png)

The board game we decided to make was called Adverdice. It was a play on words using the medium in the game (Dice) and what the game is about (Advertising) The game has 4 dice, whiteboard and a set of instructions to get you started. 

The game requires you to roll the dice and come up with an advertising campaign using the icons that you have been given, you then draw on the white board and present to the rest of the play group once everyone is done. The game is for anyone really, it can be used in a design agency to spark idea generation or it oculd be played by a bunch of friends on a friday night with a couple drinks.
